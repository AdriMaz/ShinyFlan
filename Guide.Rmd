The R package **flan** available on CRAN [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flan) provides tools for
fluctuation analysis of mutant cell counts. It includes functions dedicated to the distribution of final numbers of mutant cells. Parametric estimation and hypothesis testing are also implemented, enabling inference on different sorts of data with several possible methods, under different model assumptions.
Since many settings are possible with **flan**, its usage can be quite complicated and confusing, in particular for user who are uninitiated or beginner in R.

In that sense, the web tool **ShinyFlan** developed with the R package **shiny** allows to use **flan** without knowledge in R.

## Hypothesis testing
The first panel is dedicated to one-sample and two-sample tests (`flan.test` of **flan**).

### Data File

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(magrittr, quietly = TRUE)
mc <- readLines("mc.txt") %>%
    paste0(collapse="\n") %>%
    openssl::base64_encode()
mcfn <- readLines("mc_fn.txt") %>%
  paste0(collapse="\n") %>%
  openssl::base64_encode()
```

Data are sample of integers, interpreted as final numbers of mutant cells (<a href="`r sprintf('data:text/plain;base64,%s', mc)`">example</a>).
 They can be coupled with final numbers of cells (<a href="`r sprintf('data:text/plain;base64,%s', mcfn)`">example</a>). Data file must be `csv`, `txt`, or `xls` file.

When a data file has been selected, it is printed on the main panel.
Moreover, a histogram of the mutant counts is plotted. The dashed line represent the **jackpot** delimitation: all counts larger than this value can be considered as jackpots. This value is arbitrary and is computed summing the empirical median with 1.5 times the interquartile range.

### Settings

All the inputs of the `flan.test` function can be set:
+ You can set the value of **Death parameter**, **Platting efficiency** or the **Fitness** (if **Unknown fitness** is unmarked) in the appropriate text boxes under the sample.
+ Even if the mutant counts are not coupled with final number of cells, it is possible to consider the case where the final number of cell is random. When **Random final counts** is marked, you can set the value of the **Mean final number** and the **Coefficient of variation** (ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) of cells using the appropriate text boxes.
+ If mutant counts are coupled with final numbers of cells or when **Random final counts** is checked, the mutation probability is considered instead of the mean number of mutations.
+ When **Two sample test** is checked, the above settings can be different for the two samples.
+ Two growth model are available:
  * Luria-Delbrück model (**LD**): the lifetime of any mutant cell is assumed to be exponential;
  * Haldane model (**H**): the lifetime of any mutant cell is assumed to be constant.
+ Three estimation methods are available:
  * Maximum Likelihood method (**ML**);
  * Generating Function method (**GF**);
  * P0 method (**P0**).
+ When ML or P0 method is selected, likelihood optimization can be very long and numerically unstable. One way to reduce these tail effects is the Winsorization: it consists in truncating the sample beyond some maximal value (**Winsor parameter**).
+ You can also choose the null values and the alternative hypotheses for the mutation number/probability and the fitness (if **Unknown fitness** is checked), and the level of the confidence intervals.
+ Histograms describing the mutant counts are exposed. It is possible to modify the number of classes and the maximal value.

When **Two sample test** is checked, most of the above settings can be different between the two samples.

### Result

Once you have launched the statistical test, the R input and output are printed.
The estimated distribution of each sample is plotted and added to the related histogram.   
Moreover, a PDF file which summarizes the data, the settings, the result and the decision can be downloaded (**PDF report** button). The graphic outputs of the report are drawn using **Graphic settings**.

## Simulation
The second panel is dedicated to the simulation of mutant counts under different assumptions (function `rflan` of **flan**).

### Parameters
Different parameters are available for the simulation. Here are some details:
+ Four distributions are possible for mutant lifetime:
  * **Exponential** distribution: the lifetime of any mutant cell is assumed to be exponential;
  * **Constant** lifetimes: the lifetime of any mutant cell is assumed to be constant;
  * **Log-Normal** distribution: in that case, you have to set the mean and standard deviation of the distribution on the log-scale;
  * **Gamma** distribution: in that case, you have to set the shape and the scale of the distribution.
+ Whatever the choice of the distribution, its parameter will be adjusted in order to get a unit growth rate. In particular, the rate for the exponential case and the location for the constant case are directly adjusted according to the **Death parameter**.
+ If **Random final counts** is checked, final numbers of cells are also sampled. Three cases are possible:
  * Constant final number of cells;
  * Log-Normal distributed final number of cells;
  * Gamma distributed final number of cells.
+ In the last two cases, the parameters of the distribution are adjusted to obtain the chosen mean and coefficient of variation.

When the button **Sample** is triggered, the R input and output appear on the main panel.
Moreover, a histogram of the mutant counts is plotted. The theoretical distribution can also be added if:
  * The final number of cells is not considered;
  * The lifetime of any mutant is exponential or constant.

### Estimation

You can also perform parametric estimation (function `mutestim` of **flan**) on the simulated sample. The available settings are the same as in the first panel. The estimated distribution can also be added to the histogram (the graphic settings are the same as in the first panel).
